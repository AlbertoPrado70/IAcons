# IAcons

This project contains a collection of icons and images created with DALLE3 that you can freely use in any project.

## How does it work?

With a simple prompt and the ChatGPT API, I generated various icons, then used Potrace to convert them into a more web-friendly format.

## Are there colored icons?

No.

## Eleventy to the rescue

I used Eleventy to display all the icons in a simple manner.

The live version is available on my blog.

I constantly update the page, so you can bookmark it to see new content.
